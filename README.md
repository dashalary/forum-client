## Forum

Welcome to Forum! This single page app was made to facilitate conversations and engagement through posts and comments. It uses a React-Redux frontend and a Rails API backend, the latter of which can be found [here](https://github.com/dashalary/forum-api)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Installation

To begin, clone this repository and run the following in your terminal:

``$npm install``
``$npm start``


In the backend, run:

``$rails db:migrate``
``$rails s``
